## Purpose
Journey is a mobile journaling application that allows users to write daily journal entries, where an AI model conducts sentiment analysis to keep a daily record of the user’s feelings. Journey’s motivation is to enhance the journaling experience by serving as an emotional outlet, and allowing users to track their emotional stress on a daily basis. By providing a compartmentalized record of their emotions, users can keep track of their emotional patterns, and can access the content of particular journal entries to reflect and realize possible triggers for negative emotions.
